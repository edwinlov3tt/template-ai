Short answer: **Claude’s plan is excellent and aligns with what I’ve been recommending.** I’d keep ~90% of it. Below are a few **tweaks/cautions** so you don’t accidentally ship new edge-case bugs, plus a curated pack of **docs/papers to feed into Claude** so it nails the tricky parts.

# What I’d tweak (to avoid subtle bugs)

1. **Pointer Events + capture** — yes, unify input. But only call `setPointerCapture` on the *element that received* the `pointerdown`, and remember capture auto-releases on `pointerup`. Don’t rely on bubbling order for release logic. ([MDN Web Docs][1])

2. **Passive listeners** — mark `wheel`/touch listeners **passive** *only* where you will never call `preventDefault()`. If you’ll intercept zoom/pan, keep those specific listeners non-passive. This avoids the Chrome perf warning without breaking gestures. ([Chrome for Developers][2])

3. **CTM caching** — caching `getScreenCTM()` is great, but **invalidate the cache** on: zoom/pan changes, window resize, device-pixel-ratio changes, or when the `<svg>` moves (e.g., layout shift). Using the cached CTM outside those moments is fine. ([MDN Web Docs][3])

4. **Overlay positioning** — your “OverlayPositioner” is the right idea; just ensure it always converts **SVG rect → screen** using CTM, then translates to the editor container’s client rect (you’ve proposed this). That keeps chips/tooltips glued to rotated/scaled elements. ([MDN Web Docs][3])

5. **Constraints (kiwi)** — pick a maintained Kiwi build and validate text constraints *before* solving (the `headline.fontSize <= 36` parse failure you saw is a classic). Consider a micro-DSL or wrapper that returns structured errors. (Two actively maintained Kiwi repos are available.) ([GitHub][4])

6. **Undo/redo** — the command/merge approach is correct. Just don’t put *selection* into history; it causes noisy stacks. Keep selection in UI state, and only push **data mutations** (move/resize/setProperty). That’s consistent with editor UX norms (and reduces memory churn).

7. **Spatial indexing** — if you add snapping/guides for many objects, drop edges into **RBush** and query by bbox during drag; it’s a big win vs O(n) scans. ([GitHub][5])

8. **Import pipeline** — offload heavy SVG cleanup to a **Worker** (Comlink is a great fit; you can even use a Vite plugin to reduce boilerplate). Keep `viewBox` during SVGO (never remove it; removing breaks scaling/reflow). ([GitHub][6])

9. **State machine** — great call. If you don’t want to hand-roll, XState gives you guards/history/inspectors out of the box and will make complex gesture interactions easier to reason about. ([Stately][7])

10. **SVG rules to codify** — enforce at import time:

* Must have **`viewBox`**.
* Replace `xlink:href` with **`href`** (SVG2).
* For recolor-only vectors, prefer **flattened compound paths** + a small palette.
  These prevent many “nothing renders” or “everything is white” scenarios you saw. ([MDN Web Docs][8])

# Where Claude’s plan shines (keep these)

* **Separation**: Presentation / Interaction / Coordination / State / Utilities is exactly the layering you want.
* **Command pattern** with merge: avoids history explosions from color pickers/drags.
* **Selection manager** with union bbox: unlocks multi-select properly.
* **OverlayPositioner**: fixes your floating chip once and for all.
* **Phased migration with feature flag**: ship safely without blocking V1.
  (That’s all straight from your plan and I’m +1 on it. )

# Feed these sources to Claude (they map 1:1 to the tricky parts)

* **Pointer Events & capture** (unify mouse/touch/stylus, handle capture correctly): MDN overview + `setPointerCapture()` examples. ([MDN Web Docs][1])
* **Passive listeners** (fix the Lighthouse warning without breaking gestures): Chrome best-practices. ([Chrome for Developers][2])
* **SVG coordinate systems** (`getScreenCTM`, `viewBox`, `getBBox`) for robust DOM↔SVG math. ([MDN Web Docs][3])
* **Cassowary/kiwi** (constraints for auto-layout): the original Cassowary paper/tech report + a maintained Kiwi.js repo. ([badros.com][9])
* **RBush** (snapping speed): spatial index for edges/handles. ([GitHub][5])
* **Comlink (+ Vite plugin)** (workerizing your importer): less boilerplate, faster UI. ([GitHub][6])
* **SVGO config** (don’t remove `viewBox`; keep IDs when needed): official plugin docs + context. ([svgo.dev][10])
* **XState docs** (if you choose a lib SM): statecharts, guards, testing. ([Stately][7])

# Concrete “gotcha” examples (so Claude codegen avoids them)

* **Do not** mark the canvas `wheel` listener passive if you call `preventDefault()` for zoom; instead, attach a **separate** passive wheel on the container for scrolling, and a **non-passive** wheel on the canvas only while zoom is enabled. ([Chrome for Developers][2])
* Cache the **inverse CTM** once per interaction (pointerdown → pointerup). Recompute only when zoom/pan/resize changes. ([MDN Web Docs][3])
* When converting SVG→screen for overlays, always go **via CTM**, then subtract the container’s `getBoundingClientRect()`; don’t mix DOM offsets with raw SVG numbers. ([MDN Web Docs][3])
* SVGO: keep `viewBox` (the plugin doc itself warns removing it breaks scaling). ([svgo.dev][10])
* For constraints, prefer **hard validation** of parsed constraints *before* solving (reject or downgrade to fallback layout on parse failure); don’t let a bad token (e.g., `<=`) crash the pass. Use a maintained Kiwi build. ([GitHub][4])

## Verdict

* **Yes** — Claude’s plan is on-strategy.
* The **edits above** are mostly about **invalidating caches at the right times**, **when to use passive listeners**, and **never removing `viewBox`**. If you hand these sources to Claude, it will have the guardrails it needs to produce robust code the first time.

If you want, I can generate a **checklist PR** (one commit per tweak) that your team + Claude can follow step-by-step, starting with: (1) Pointer Events + capture, (2) passive listener fix, (3) CTM cache with invalidation hooks, (4) Worker-ized importer with Comlink, (5) Kiwi constraint wrapper with friendly errors.
